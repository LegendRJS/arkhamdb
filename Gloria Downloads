when I attempt to download a Glorai Golburge deck made on Arkham DB as an otgon file I get the message Warning: Some cards from this deck are missing OCTGN IDs (most likely the latest cards or the special random basic weakness card)
this does not happen with any other investogtor
I ahve checked it is not the random eekens , and triedto dowload Glora decks from the pulbic deks and get same problem.
